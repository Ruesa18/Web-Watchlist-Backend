# Web-Watchlist-Backend
A Spring Boot API in which you can create a watchlist with movies and series you want to see in the future.
You can also check the ones you have already seen and should be able to get offers of similar series you might like.
Thanks to the imdb API you will be able to see when a selected movie will be showed in cinema.
